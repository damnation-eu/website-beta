# Ranks

Apprentice and Journeyman are ranks that are part of your membership to the servers in NetherEndingStory. Do not nag admins about being ranked up, doing so will only lower your chances of getting it. Our ranks are a privilege and not a right. We keep track of players commitment to the server, playing time, voting, builds, helpfulness and general behavior and we'll contact you when we think you are ready.

## Non Members

### Tourist
<span style="color: #999999;">**Light Gray**</span> - The guest rank cant build or destroy, only look, chat, move around and go through portals. A "tourist" so to speak. While as a tourist, players can still play on the Minigames and CivCraft servers. A subset of this rank is Ghost - which is the punishment rank for miscreants. Ghosts can only look and move, not even chat.

### Peon
<span style="color: #4c4c4c;">**Dark Gray**</span> - Regular visitors of the server who are not approved members may be promoted to a subset of the peon rank that is a darker gray. This rank adds no new permissions and only acts to distinguish those who are regular tourists. 


## Members

### Apprentice
<span style="color: #00cd00;">**Green**</span> - The first probationary rank. Can do most things, but have a few limitations for protection and avoiding grief.

### Journeyman
<span style="color: #00e5e5;">**Aqua**</span> - The regular full member rank. You will be promoted here after you have played a couple of weeks, have a minimum of 10 hours actual play time and finished your first build properly (normally the city plot). When you fill these requirements you can contact an admin for promotion. Most members will probably be/stay of this rank. Most focus of the server is having the Journeyman class fully balanced and getting the broadest/fullest experience.

### Craftsman
<span style="color: #00e5e5;">**[$] Aqua**</span> - Initial donor rank. Have several extra enhancements and conveniences - as thanks for donations.

### Initiate
<span style="color: #4c4cff;">**Blue**</span> - Veteran/trusted members. Can use TNT and some other more dangerous things such as WorldEdit in Creative Plotworld. We need to see a serious commitment to the server before you can gain this rank. Normally this means some major in-game contribution, a lot of time spent (including regular voting), or completing an approved mega-build. Online time should be a minimum of 100 hours (4 days) and an admin will want to inspect and approve some of your builds. A clean record of no warnings and issues will also help.

### Artisan
<span style="color: #4c4cff;">**[$] Blue**</span> - Veteran/trusted donor rank. It is like Initiate but for donors. Obtained through significant in-game contributions just like Initiate or through a larger donation.

### Architect
<span style="color: #e5c100;">**Gold**</span> - True gold status member. Reserved for our trusted outstanding community members with several weeks of gametime and significant contributions to the server in a variety of ways. Those who obtain this rank are nominated by staff members factoring in a few concrete requirements, but largely weighing the intangible positives.

## Staff
Unlike some servers, becoming staff on damNation should never be an expectation, but rather a privilege that comes with many responsibilities and high levels of trust. Our entirely volunteer staff work long and hard to keep damnNation the best it can be so all can enjoy its community and features. However, you can do your part by error-reporting and giving other feedback that help us make sure we are running the kind of server we can all enjoy. If you'd like to know more about our staff members, talk to them in game or visit their Staff Biography Pages.

### Adjunct
<span style="color: #f2afcc;">**Pink**</span> - Moderator rank. These staff members are in charge of chat and player moderation.

### Magister
<span style="color: red;">**Red**</span> - Admin rank and our main staff rank. These staff members are equipped to handle the bulk of admin work needed on the server, from setting up regions, to welcoming and helping players, to handling disputes and griefings.

### Maestro
<span style="color: #7f0000;">**Dark Red**</span> - Owner rank. These staff members handle a great deal of the backend of server maintenance in addition to the in-game duties of Magisters.
