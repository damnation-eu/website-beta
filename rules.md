# Rules and Policies

Whether you've successfully reached Initiate or just looking to see if you want to join our server, our rules and policies sections has been created to go in to detail about why our rules are what they are. Hopefully if you read this section you will not have any questions about the most frequently asked "do I, or don't I?" subjects. Most of it is common sense, but some if it is particular to this server.

This server is intended for mature players with more than half-a-brain and we expect EVERYONE here to behave accordingly.

## Server Rules

- **Rule 1** - You must be at least <span style="color: red;">**18**</span> years of age. [Read more](/website-beta/membership-age) about why we have a minimum age requirement.

- **Rule 2** - Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree.

- **Rule 3** - If you would not like somebody doing to you, what you are thinking of doing to them, DO NOT do it. We're talking common, real world, sense here, folks.

```
      Hacked clients, using cheats, taking advantage of glitches will land you in trouble.
```

- **Rule 4** - No exploits, duping, cheating, stealing, griefing, hacking, modded clients etc. We do allow some Client mods. Find out more.

```
      We have particular build requirements which you should pay close attention to.
```

- **Rule 5** - Gather resources, but leave the landscape looking natural and beautiful, please.

- **Rule 6** - No giant 2d builds outside of creative worlds. The only place you can build giant pixelart, voxelart, flags etc is creative.

- **Rule 7** - Put effort in to all your builds, build with taste.

- **Rule 8** - Build beyond <span style="color: red;">**128**</span> blocks from your neighbor.

- **Rule 9** - Redstone contraptions must not impinge on server performance.

- **Rule 10** - If your conduct results in receiving instructions from a staff member (dark red, red, and pink names), always obey.

- **Rule 11** - No chat spam or flooding, no caps spam, no commercials for other servers or any commercial services. No excessive swearing and no swearing at other players.
- **Rule 12** - Report misbehaviour, grief, exploits and bugs to staff using the forum, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother staff for op or admin rights.
- **Rule 13** - Mobtowers/XPgrinders etc are allowed in MODERATION. In relation to both XP and Items: No collection of items/xp while afk; no unattended automation of item/xp gathering, including mcmmo experience; and absolutely no unattended macroing. With an off-switch, and do not build in heavily populated areas. You are not allowed to let any mob stack up more than about 100 in a chunk, you should add a way to quickly kill mobs if they do stack up. (excessive stacking of monsters is cause for warning/demotion/ban!). Furthermore, towers must be covered and look like actual builds (not like flying platforms) - follow the building rules and some aesthetics please. No one wants to see giant cobble/wood cubes in the landscape.
- **Rule 14** - No commercials for other servers or any commercial services
- **Rule 15** - On your registration to enter the server: Take the bold red number from Rule 1 on this rule overview page and ADD it to the bold red number from Rule #8 on this page, above, look.... it sticks out like a sore thumb, do you see it? Ahh good, you got it. Now write the total (aka sum) when asked. Thank you for understanding we only do this to make sure people read the rules' overview properly. It's an amazingly effective mechanism, and you'll love the result of it once you join our community. You'd be amazed how many people just skim read, particularly younger people. Thanks for your understanding in keeping this such an awesome server.

```
      You are expected to uphold the spirit and the letter of the rules on all our servers.
```

If you are reading this page looking for the sum, please carefully read each rule.

## Policies

We have a number of policies that deal with issues and situations outside of the set of rules above. Please read and understand all of our policies listed below.

### Bans and Appeals

#### Bans

Most people who visit our fine server are nice and polite. Unfortunately some, mostly confused youngsters, just don't know how to behave in a social internet environment or think that ruining the game by cheating is something worthy spending time on. Most of the time we can resolve issues peacefully, or just by muting. However, a select few we feel need to be banned, and other server owners should know about them too (that is why we have global banning systems). A ban for breaking the rules of one of our servers is a ban from all of our servers.

```
       We see & log EVERYTHING! Not following the rules = BAN
```

Members bans are placed in the [Banned Members](http://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=41) forum and a tombstone is usually placed at /warp graveyard. We do not make individual threads for visitor users, so you can find these additional bans from our server on our [MCBans page](http://mcbans.com/server/damNation.eu).

### Appeals

You may immediately appeal a ban and state your case by sending a PM to an admin or posting a thread in the appropriate forum.
If you were globally banned and believe this to be unfair or in error, you can also make your appeal directly on our [MCBans page](http://mcbans.com/server/damNation.eu) to have the global ban revoked. Primarily this is in case of a mistake or misunderstanding.
**A ban is usually permanent** - especially if cheating. You should have read the rules better! However, banned players (that failed, or did not make an immediate appeal) are eligible to make a reapplication after a **minimum of 3 months**, the circumstances can then be discussed but there is absolutely **no guarantee of re-admission** (it depends on the violations, and how you make your appeal). We like to think that players can grow up (you must convince us you have!), and we can forgive and forget.

---

## Client Mods

We do not allow any form of hack or cheat packs, such as xrays, flymods, speed mods, spider climb, avoiding fall-damage, etc. The excuse "I forgot I had it enabled" doesn't cut-it. Whatever gives you an unfair advantage when it comes to resources can be considered cheating. Any use of these violates our rules and will result in a global ban.

However, we do allow a handful of client mods that improve or ease your Minecraft gameplay. We are not going to pursue and argue about tweaks, macros, minor helpers etc. If you believe a certain mod or function to be on the borderline, ask on the forums and we will give an official decision. If anti-cheat plugins interfere with the functions of any of the approved mods, let us know.

Before we get to this list, this is a fair warning - **ANY** client-side mod that is not on this list could get you intro trouble if it is deemed to give an unfair advantage. For your sake and for ours, ask about any client-side mod you use that is not on this list.

<span style="color: green;">**Green Zone**</span> - Always allowed

* **Optifine**
* **TabbyChat**
* **Convenient Inventory**
* **Inventory Tweaks**
* **M_Debugmod**
* **Voxel Map**
* **NoVoidFog**
* **Damage Indicators**
* **Any Shaders Pack**


<span style="color: gray;">**Gray Zone**</span> - Borderline. You would be wise to ask about these

* **Mod Macros** - functions that give an unfair advantage in PvP and allow for AFK mining and farming of any kind are prohibited.
* **Schematica and World Downloader** - fine for use with your own builds, but not for other purpose. Must be approved on a case by case basis.


<span style="color: red;">**Red Zone**</span> - Illegal. Any use will lead to fines, demotions, or global bans. Including but not limited to:

* **Any of the notorious hacking clients**
* **Xray Mods**
* **Fly Mod**
* **Auto Fishing or other AFK mods**
* **Brightness Mods**
* **Parachute Mods**
* **Speed Mods**
* **Kill Aura**
* **Fast Attacking**

## Grief and Theft

Our rules adequately cover every-day grief and theft issues, which will result in a ban. There are some instances where further explanation is required, however.

### Players who Quit

Regardless of how long ago a player was on the server, their builds are still considered theirs and theirs only. You may not raze any old build without prior approval from an admin. We will give approval where it makes sense, usually when a build is unfinished or insignificant. Never take that decision yourself.

### Banned Players

When it comes to banned players, you may absolutely **NOT** go and take their stuff or raze their builds. When a player is banned, **all their rights, their builds and all their stuff belongs to the State**. Any resource acquisition is decided by the admins. Even if you know the person IRL, or regardless of what they say when they are banned is of no consequence. Once a ban is in place, the state owns everything they did. I.e. a banned player may not donate or give anything to friends still on the server. If there is something you need or did together, you must ask for admin approval (which is of course given where it makes sense).

---

## Referral Bonus

If new applicants list you as the referrer, you will receive 200c when they become an Apprentice. To earn this, you must verify that you referred them in their application thread before it is approved **OR** verify an admin afterwards.

We also notice players are helpful with tourists in chat and helping them join, which we like. But telling them to put you up as the referrer in their application will be noted and in such cases we will not pay the referral fee. Note that if that player is banned/warned you will be fined at least 400 crowns. So make sure you refer those players that you know and not only to make a quick buck off a tourist you don't know.
