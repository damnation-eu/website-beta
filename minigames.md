#Minigames

Our newly renovated minigame server is the result of countless hours of work by countless admins over several iterations of the server. It functions as the hub for Minigames and Adventure maps. The current server is up today thanks to the work of admins (Kurusca, jjoonn56, bunnies1230, Madame, and NathanBooch), builders (Deddah, fat_leeloo, and Critter) and many, many helpful beta testers.

##What can I do there?
We have a constantly expanding list of minigames and adventure maps. All of your favorites from the arcade world like Mob Arena and Capture The Flag have been given makeovers and coexist with some new features like BlockHunt, MarioKart, and QuakeCraft. The economies are linked between PvE and Minigames, so you can earn and spend your crowns freely!

##Community Input
Our minigames server is a community-driven server. Nearly all of our maps and buildings are created by damNation members or staff, and we’re always looking for new submissions. If you love a minigame and want to create a map for it or have a build you think would be a great addition, let us know! Not every map will be accepted and by allowing us to use it, we reserve the right to make changes for the purposes of integration. Likewise, if you come across a plugin that is at least for version 1.7 that you would like to see on the server, post it on the [Minigames forum](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=48)! If the plugin will fit in with the rest of the server, we’ll work to add it!

##Rules

* All main server rules apply.
* Do not seek out or abuse exploits in any minigame. If you find one, report it to a staff member and you’ll earn our good graces.
* Obey the rules specific to each minigame.
* Have fun, explore the land, and be excellent!

##Commands
There are only a handful of game-specific commands you will need to know. The majority of the server is set up so that you can just right click a sign to join/leave a game, rather than remember a command. In the few cases where it is necessary to type the command, rather than click a sign, the command will be written out for you.

##Staff
If you have any questions, about the server, you can ask any admin, but direct most comments, questions, and concerns to the leading developers of the server, **bunnies1230** and **Madame**.
