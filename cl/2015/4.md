* Fixed the lapis and book donation stations at the XP Farm. Items will now feed directly into the dispensers.
* Added an in-game staff feedback station! Located at /warp daily, you can fill out a book and toss it onto the crafting benches below to submit it! Feel free to give us minor suggestions, thanks, criticism, and other notes. We'll read them! You don't need to sign the book, so it can be completely anonymous if you wish.

*Updated BetterShops to 1.6.0. Fixed issues with players not being able to arrange items. This update also adds a hard Sell Limit -  whatever you set this item to is the maximum stock the shop will hold at any time. Only if you take stock out of the shop will people be able to sell more items to you.

* [Stables](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/stables/) re-enabled and updated to v1.9.7 - all previously owned horses should be accessible. Enjoy!
