#Staff
</div>

Unlike some servers, becoming staff on damNation should never be an expectation, but rather a privilege that comes with many responsibilities and high levels of trust. Our entirely volunteer staff work long and hard to keep damnNation the best it can be so all can enjoy its community and features. However, you can do your part by error-reporting and giving other feedback that help us make sure we are running the kind of server we can all enjoy. If you'd like to know more about our staff members, talk to them in game or click their usernames below to read their biographies!

Aside from each staff rank, staff members have positions as well to show their specializations and focus for server development. However, someone whose position is "Event Manager" can and likely is fully capable of doing the duties of the "Groundskeeper" - these positions are meant to show the staff and the community who is in-charge of what aspect of the server.
