# Welcome to damNation, novice Goblin!
</div>

This guide is a short step-by-step introduction how to get started on damNation and how to access our features and benefits to get the most out of your stay and experience here.

Once you made a successful application, an admin will promotion to Goblin. Goblin (light green color) is a "probational" rank when you are new. You can play normally, but with just a few small limitations - mainly meant to avoid issues with grief. After playing on the server for more than a week, you will likely have mined, built a home, ran around aimlessly, killed some enemies, and leveled up some stats, and may be eligible for a promotion to Siren which is our normal "full member" status. Higher ranks are attainable through simply playing on the server! Each rank comes with some added perks, which you can [read more about here]({{site.baseurl}}/ranks)! 

Enough of that, you'll learn it all later. As a new-born Goblin you'll probably want to do the following right away:

##How To Start Out
</div>

1.  Get the free starter-kit in the information house near spawn in [Homeland]({{site.baseurl}}/homeland). Do /spawn to get there fast. It has some basics and some food so you won't starve.
2.  Vote for the server! This will get you some nice and easy cash to get started. You can vote daily on each site, earning you a nice sum per day. Check your money with <b>/money</b> or <b>/fe</b>.
3.  Get an overview of the city and the different worlds on our server. Use [our excellent dynmap](https://damnation.eu/dynmap/) to see where you are and where you can go. Homeland is the main starting world, home to our Spawn City. Find out more about [The Multiverse of damNation.eu]({{site.baseurl}}/survival-worlds). If you want to go to wilderness, homeland is currently very full - so choose another newer or custom world.
4.  Understand [how to get around in the city]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-around) (besides walking, though we highly recommend taking a stroll). List all Homeland warps with **/warps**, then go to for instance /warp alleytown (which is an area more likely to have free plots).
5.  Look around the city for a **FREE** plot. While looking at the dynmap, plots with green borders are open and free for purchase. Available plots have signs on them that says "For Sale". You can also list the available plots with **/freeplots list** and visit them with **/freeplots tp [plotID]** or **/freeplots tp random**. Players may only claim **ONE** plot in Spawn City.
  * Buy the plot by typing **/freeplots claim [plotID]** - you will find the plot ID on a sign
  * Starting plots are usually 20x20 blocks and you may build 20 high and dig as deep as you want (bedrock). Want higher? Buy some extra height with crowns.
  * Your plot is fully protected - no one else can build, destroy or take stuff from chests on it (they can open wood doors and use buttons though). However, you can easily [add players to your plot]({{site.baseurl}}/worldguard-guide) or even [share chests with them]({{site.baseurl}}/lwc-guide)!
7.  Set your home by typing **/sethome**. Now you can get back here by doing **/home** at any point in time. Goblins only have 1 home per world, but that will increase as you rank up! Extra homes must be set with a name **/sethome home2** or whatever name you like. List your homes with **/homes**. It is most comfortable to set different names in different worlds - and you can go between.
8.  Build your first home, set up your underground base, hit the wilderness, build in creative, play a minigame, or go on an adventure - it is up to you! Just remember you have up to **TWO WEEKS** to do something with your claimed city plot - **an incomplete build might return to the state due to inactivity**. We recommend most players build their first home in Spawn City, but you are free to build out in the wilderness immediately if you wish!
9.  Read up on the [many excellent plugins]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins) we have on the server. All carefully selected to help the game become less of a chore and more of a challenging, varied, fun and balanced building and adventure game. Use /help or just TAB-complete in chat if you need to find a command, or check out our: [Plugins Reference Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/plugin). Also have a look at our [Custom Recipes]({{site.baseurl}}/g/recipes).

##Need Help?
</div>

We pride ourselves as being a friendly and welcoming community. If you need help with something, asking in global chat for help will likely lead to an admin or other community member answering your question or helping you out in another way. We love helping out new members take in the enormity that is our list of server features. Don't worry about asking a lot of questions in the beginning - we were all there, once!

However, don't beg for or pester admins unless it is actually called for. If an admin is active, they will either answer you or tell you to be patient if they are currently occupied. No freebies or gifts are granted. If you still need help and no admin is around use /modreq <message>. That files a request to the admins. Be detailed and use at the location of where the problem is as the admin will teleport to the exact location where you type the /modreq.</message>

*   Use the public treefarms at /warp treefarm (all kinds of wood) or at /warp south (for pine). Remember to replant.
*   The market has a lot of materials for sale (including unobtainable items in the state store) /warp market, or if you're not in Homeland use /warp homeland market. shift+clicking the chest to get more info and if you want to buy then type the amount in chat after shift+clicking.
*   You can get as much sand as you need at the Sand farm at /warp sandfarm.
*   You can start some easy mining in the public mine at /warp publicmine. But you can certainly also set up your own mining operation in any of the many worlds' wildernesses.
*   Trade with other players.

## Want to Support the Server?
</div>

Contribute to the significant costs and development of the server by considering making a small donation and receive some nice thank you perks!

The server is run completely on idealistic terms, and OriginalMadman pays for the brunt of it out of his own personal pocket (didn't even have donations for the first 6 months of operation). All donated money will go to server running costs (we do have [dedicated monster hardware in a datacenter]({{site.baseurl}}/server-specs)) and/or improvements/advertising.

See the [Donations page]({{site.baseurl}}/donate) for details about donation rates and perks.
