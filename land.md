#Land Ownership

*For Creative land ownership, read [PlotMe Guide]({{site.baseurl}}/plotme-guide)*

Minecraft is nothing without a home. You can claim your own piece of our server to fit your needs. As you know, everyone receives one free plot when they join. Beyond that plot we have options for buying existing plots, buying your own custom build plot, or even selling plot spaces to other players.

Player plots are run and organized by our plugins, depending on which world you're in, you will have to use a different set of commands. This section of the website deals mostly with those parts of the world that require self-service regions provided via WorldGuard.

##Apply For Land
</div>
* Make sure you have enough money to afford the land **(/fe)**
* Make a new thread in the [Land Application Subforum](http://www.damnation.eu/phpbb/posting.php?mode=post&f=39)
* Give the X and Z coordinates of two opposing corners (it helps to mark these, or all 4 corners, with some blocks 3-5 high, that can be seen on the dynmap such as colored wool)
* Write in your expected area and cost
* If you want monsters off, and a reasonably short greeting message
* Preferably be online and available, and an admin will take care of it when time permits

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Pre-requisites?
</div>

Protection is always either a square or rectangular area. It must be at least 128 blocks from existing player builds UNLESS permission from that person is in the forum thread (just a note saying "ok by me" is fine).

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Dimensions
</div>

The minimum area you can protect is 100x100, and the maximum is whatever you can afford. You can expand it later for the standard 0.3c per square block cost + admin fee. The protection is from bedrock to sky limit.

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Calculating Cost
</div>

The default cost is 0.3c per square block (rounded up) that goes to the state, plus 100c for the admin doing the work. You may expand areas later, simply paying for the area of the addition plus 100c to the admin. <b>All land purchases and alterations come with the 100c admin fee.</b>

<p><b>Example:</b> 100x100 will cost 3000+100 = 3100c</p>

At the time of making the area, you may elect to turn off monsters and what (if any) greeting message you want. If you want these changed at a later date, it can also be done at an administrative fee of 100c.

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###City Zoned Plots
</div>

You may request an increase for your spawn city plot but it will need to be approved by an admin. Depending on the location of nearby plots, we reserve the right to deny expansion requests. The default cost to expand out in x/z directions is 2.0c per square block. For vertical expansions, we charge 50c per y value, with a maximum increase of 20 on the y axis.

<p><b>Example:</b> Raising the height of a plot by 20 blocks will cost 20*50 = 1000c + 100c fee</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> Expanding a 20x20 plot by 1 block East and West will cost 2*(2*(1*20)) = 80c + 100c fee</p>

##City Plots
</div>

The first city plot in [Homeland's Spawn City]({{site.baseurl}}/homeland) is free. The plot will be marked out with torches in the corners. The dimensions of the plot are typically 20x20, extending all the way down to bedrock and 20 block above street level.

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Building Code and Reposession
</div>
We enforce a loose building code in accordance with [Rule 7]({{site.baseurl}}/rules). A build must be completed within 10 days of acquiring the plot. You may be asked to complete/change a building. When the initial time period is up, we will place a warning sign outside of the plot. After a week with no significant changes, we reserve the right to demolish or repurpose

##Landscaping and Other Services
</div>
For a fee of 500c and where suitable, at his/her discretion an admin may help you clear or flatten land in/near your Wilderness plot. You may ask for land clearance to a maximum distance of 64 blocks outside around your area.

For a fee of 1000c you can have fall damage off in your private region (may help with those nice builds).

For a fee of 100c, you can request an admin to turn any number of <b>already placed</b> huge mushroom blocks into <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mushroom_(block)#Block_data">any data value of huge mushroom block</a> via World Edit. It doesn't matter if the block is from a red or brown huge mushroom - they can be turned into either. These huge mushroom blocks can be obtained through the use of a silk touch tool, however they will all be the same type of block, regardless of which one you mined.

Players can request sub-regions within their region to allow mob spawning if they have a mob spawner from a dungeon or abandoned mineshaft that they wish to turn into a mob farm. These farms still must comply with our spawner rules. We will not make sub regions to allow dark-room or non-spawner mob farms. For each request, we charge a 100c admin fee.
