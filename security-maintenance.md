We had a problem with a php trojan, using us as a relay.

Due to this we have disabled php entirely for now, until we have the time to figure out how we got infected by the trojan in the first place.

You should probably change your password since we cannot guarantee that the attackers have not used this to download the database with hashed passwords.

We're sorry if this have caused you major trouble.

If you need to contact us you can email me at faua@damnation.eu
