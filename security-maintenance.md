Note: We had a problem with a php trojan, using us as a relay. Due to this we have disabled php entirely for now, until we have the time to figure out how we got infected by the trojan in the first place.

You should probably change your password since we cannot guarantee that the attackers have not used this to download the database with hashed passwords. We're sorry if this have caused you major trouble.

If you need to contact us you can email me at faua@damnation.eu.

Dear Damnationers,

Due to recent months inactivity, and the significant cost of renting server hardware (and not nearly enough donations to cover) - I have decided to finally end the service contract after over 5 years (!) of operation on the 31/1.

What exactly will happen to the server itself is not entirely decided. But the most probable thing is that we finally lay it to rest since nobody is really playing anyway.

As promised from the very start, at the very least all the public server maps will be made available (details forthcoming). 
We're considering to share more or do another solution (possibly a home server), and we'll try to keep the website alive (although the hack we suffered really made things a big mess)

Damnation and the community will live on as you make it, please feel free to join these places as well:
