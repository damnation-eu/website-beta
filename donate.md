# Donations

It costs both money and time to run this server. The server is high-end dedicated hardware in an EU central datacenter. Annual costs of running the damNation service, RCA, websites, hosting, upgrades, totals over 1000 euros. But no worries, we're not going away anytime soon regardless. The server owner (who is Swedish, in case you are wondering why you can donate specifically in SEK) and staff can afford it, but some help, dedication and a show of appreciation of this “free” service you take advantage of is always welcomed.

We NEVER cripple non-donating members.

Journeyman is the regular Full Member non-donor class, and it will remain fully featured.

Donations are strictly voluntary, and is something you do because you love the server and want to contribute a bit. First and foremost you receive a warm and cuddly feeling because you are helping keep this epic service online. Secondly, you MAY receive perks. These will never be game-breaking or unbalancing towards non-donors. However, these are perks. They are not guaranteed to be available, nor remain consistent in features. They WILL change. You must accept that.


## Donating

All money raised goes 100% to server maintenance/upgrade costs and buying ads/premium stuff for the server. Current goals are to reclaim some monthly costs, get and paying to support server marketing efforts.

The suggested minimum donation amount is 10 euro, the minimum to give you donor privileges. You may donate less, or more of course.

Note: Donor privileges is a boon, they are NOT a "right". It is not a service you are buying, it is a thanks you are granted. Remember this difference. Rules must still be followed, and we reserve the right to remove privileges and ban users.
